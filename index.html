  <p title="Andrew J Wolff CV">Motivated autodidact interested in pushing myself in new and challenging directions. I've traveled extensively and spent considerable time surmounting innumerable challenges in life. I've spent most of my professional life helping people feel comfortable
    in trying circumstances and want to take those skills into an entirely different field</p>

  <h2>Professional</h2>
  <p>First off, Nikola Tesla was brilliant. And not just like Ken Jennings brilliant, either - I mean like, "holy crap my head just exploded (from all the awesome)" brilliant.
    <ul>
      <li>He spoke eight languages
      </li>
      <li>almost single-handedly developed technology that harnessed the power of electricity for household use
      </li>
      <li>invented electrical generators</li>
      <li>FM radio</li>
      <li>remote control robots</li>
      <li>spark plugs</li>
      <li>fluorescent lights</li>
      <li>giant machines that shot lightning bolts</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjwolff"><img src=https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13346603_10205793371983075_7957317996439601927_n.jpg?oh=326a70be547099cd3e797c427501cbb7&oe=57CE8391 alt=“LIGHTNING” style="float:right;width:250px;height:250px;"></a>
    <p>He had an unyielding, steel-trap photographic memory and an insane ability to visualize even the most complex pieces of machinery – the guy did advanced calculus and physics equations in his damn head, memorized entire books at a time, and successfully
      pulled off scientific experiments that modern-day technology STILL can't replicate. For instance, in 2007 a group of lesser geniuses at MIT got all pumped up out of their minds because they wirelessly transmitted energy a distance seven feet through
      the air. Nikola Tesla once lit 200 lightbulbs from a power source 26 miles away, and he did it in 1899 with a machine he built from spare parts in the middle of the god-forsaken desert. To this day, nobody can really figure out how the hell he pulled
      that shit off, because two-thirds of the schematics only existed in the darkest recesses of Tesla's all-powerful brain.</p>

    <p>Of course, much like many other eccentric giga-geniuses and diabolical masterminds, Tesla was also completely insane. He was prone to nervous breakdowns, claimed to receive weird visions in the middle of the night, spoke to pigeons, and occasionally
      thought he was receiving electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrials on Mars. He was also obsessive-compulsive and hated round objects, human hair, jewelry, and anything that wasn't divisible by three. He was also asexual and celibate for his
      entire life. Basically, Nikola Tesla was the ultimate mad scientist, which is seriously awesome.</p>

    <p>Another sweet thing about Tesla is that he conducted the sort of crazy experiments that generally result in hordes of angry villagers breaking down the door to your lab with torches and pitchforks. One time, while he was working on magnetic resonance,
      he discovered the resonant frequency of the Earth and caused an earthquake so powerful that it almost obliterated the 5th Avenue New York building that housed his Frankenstein Castle of a laboratory. Stuff was flying off the walls, the drywall was
      breaking apart, the cops were coming after him, and Tesla had to smash his device with a sledge hammer to keep it from demolishing an entire city block. Later, he boasted that he could have built a device powerful enough to split the Earth in two.
      Nobody dared him to prove it.</p>

    <p>Tesla also ordered the construction of the Wardenclyffe Tesla Tower, a giant building shaped like an erect penis that would have housed the largest Tesla coil ever built. The massive structure, ostensibly designed to wirelessly transmit power, has
      been cited as a potential cause of the mysterious 1908 Tunguska Event – a ten-megaton blast that detonated in the wastelands above central Russia that completely obliterated and deforested everything unlucky enough to be located within a several
      hundred mile radius. While nothing has ever successfully proven Tesla's involvement in the ass-destroyingly huge explosion, it's pretty awesome that this guy could potentially have detonated a weapon 1,000 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb
      that destroyed Hiroshima, and have done it back before they'd even invented the submachine gun.</p>
